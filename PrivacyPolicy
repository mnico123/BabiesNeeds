# Privacy Policy for BabiesNeeds

**Last Updated:** October 29, 2025

Thank you for using BabiesNeeds. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and handle your information when you use our mobile application.

## Information We Collect

To provide you with our service, we collect the following types of information:

*   **Account Information:** When you sign up and log in using "Sign in with Apple," we receive a unique user identifier from Apple. Depending on the permissions you grant, we may also receive your name and email address. If you choose to hide your email, Apple will provide us with a private relay email address.

*   **User-Generated Content:** We collect and store the data you explicitly provide, which includes:
    *   Baby profile information (name, date of birth, gender).
    *   Event data you log (feeds, sleep start/end times, diaper changes, etc.).

## How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect for the sole purpose of providing and improving the app's core functionality:

*   To securely store and display your baby's event history.
*   To sync your data across your devices (iPhone and Apple Watch).
*   To enable the real-time data synchronization when you share a profile with a partner or caregiver.
*   To power the prediction engine that helps you anticipate your baby's needs.
*   To respond to your support requests.

## Information Sharing and Disclosure

Your privacy is critically important to us. We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information with any third parties for marketing purposes.

Information is only shared in the following limited circumstance:

*   **With Your Invited Users:** When you voluntarily use the "Invite Code" feature to share a baby's profile, the user(s) who correctly enter that code will gain access to that specific baby's profile and all associated event data.

We use Google Firebase (a third-party service) for our backend infrastructure, including database hosting (Firestore) and authentication. Google's use of this data is governed by its own privacy policy.

## Data Security

We take reasonable measures to protect your information. All data is stored in Google Firebase and is protected by Firebase's robust security infrastructure and our own security rules to prevent unauthorized access.

## Data Retention and Deletion

We retain your data as long as your account is active. You are in full control of your data. You can delete individual events or entire baby profiles from within the app at any time. Deleting a baby profile permanently removes that baby and all of its associated event history from our database.

## Children's Privacy

Our service is intended for use by parents and caregivers, who are adults. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete that information as quickly as possible.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new privacy policy on this page.
